          <h1>Qur'An</h1>
          <p><em><strong>Hi my name is Qur'An From Cohort rich 3</strong></em></p>
          <p>I grew up in Richmond, California. I found intrest in video games around the age of 8 I woke up in the middle of the night and my brother was playing his ps2. I hopped out of my bed and asked if I can play and he let me. From that day I
            enjoyed video games. When I was in the 4th grade I started playing more online games and it became more diffcult to do things that I would with a cpu (A computer player) and it made my experience better I got to see how other people play
            how they act and figured out what they do in other countries. After the 4th grade I stop playing video games as much I lost intrest in them. I started playing sports and being more active. I didn't really watch videos about them or
            anything
            that had to do with them. Through those years I've been asked what I wanted to be and I never had a answer I never really cared about the future cause I didn't understand how important the future is and how much of that decision would
            impact me. Once I got into the 7th grade I met a couple of people who enjoyed playing video games the same way I did. So throughout the school year we all started playing video games and that's when I got the idea of creating a video game
            one day after that I decided if I'm going to work at a job i'm going to have one that I enjoy doing. That's why I joined the hidden genius project To learn how to code so I can use these skills I am learning to build my future games. I my
            dream is to own my own gaming company one day. I'm glad that I took this opportunity that put me around a bunch of people I feel comfortable around and will help me up when I fall down.</p>
